My name is Chris DeLuca, and this, if you haven't guessed it already, this is my blog. My interests are pretty varied, so if you like one of my topics, there's a good chance you won't like the rest. I'm good with marketing like that.

My primary interests are comedy, writing, programming, and gaming, and I make an effort to keep them all properly categorized, so you can fearlessly ignore the stuff you don't want to know about.

I am employed as a front end developer at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, I am a member of the improv comedy team [Call Your Mom](http://callyourmom.org), and am a long time D&D player, among many other games.

I live in New York City.[^nyc]
